`1st Project - Guitar
I'm a casual guitar player who's played many instruments since middle school. Recently my guitar colection has grown with the fender acoustic!
I've dabbled in music since I was a child and music as well as playing instruments is a gigantic part of who it is I am. 

2nd Project - Streaming
I've been a part time streamer for around 2 years now, first getting into it while competiting in a few online games. 
I've played competitively in multiple games over the years.
I look forward to having a better schedule that will allow me to grow my community further.

Third Project - Video Games
I imagine it doesn't come as a surprise that someone who streams also partakes in video games.
I've been playing games since I was a toddler when I got my first console (the NES).
Since then I've jumped from platform to platform finally landing on PC gaming. 
I'm also some what of a collector having memorabilia from all kinds of games and platforms!`;
